#Project Title : Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Description
Handelling missing values and duplicates was our first step, and secondly we moved to Exploratry data analysis where we performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on all the features of our datset. We first analysed our dependent variable, 'Rented Bike Count' & independet variables like month, weekend and hours etc.further we moved toword variables correlation and their relationship with the others We also removed some features.could create dummie variables of categorical variables.in last we implemented 6 machine learning algorithms Linear Regression,Lasso,ridge,Decission Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost.none of them showed overfitting.Random Forest Model has given accuracy upto 90% which is preety good for prediction and choosing it for deployment
we created our webapp by streamlit library and deployed it on Heroku

## Dataset Information
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

## Business Goal:
we were required to builed model of demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
